# Minesweeper
The Minesweeper Game is a classic puzzle game where the player's objective is to uncover all the tiles on the board without hitting any mines. This implementation of Minesweeper is built using the pygame library and offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for an engaging gaming experience.

Features:
- Gameplay: The game presents a grid of tiles, some of which contain mines. Players can left-click to reveal a tile and right-click to flag a tile they suspect contains a mine. The goal is to reveal all tiles without detonating any mines.
- Board Generation: The game generates a random board layout with mines placed in different positions for each playthrough.-
- Win and Lose Conditions: The game ends when the player either successfully reveals all non-mine tiles (win) or detonates a mine (lose).
